Typoglycemia is a neologism for a purported recent discovery about the cognitive
processes behind reading written text. The word appears to be a portmanteau of
"typo", as in typographical error, and "hypoglycemia". It is an urban
legend/Internet meme that appears to have an element of truth to it.[1] No such
research was carried out at the University of Cambridge.[1]

An example of this text, as circulated in September 2003, reads as follows:

According to a researcher at Cambridge University, it doesn't matter in what
order the letters in a word are, the only important thing is that the first and
last letter be at the right place. The rest can be a total mess and you can
still read it without problem. This is because the human mind does not read
every letter by itself, but the word as a whole.

https://www.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/people/matt.davis/cmabridge/ A few mistakes were
made:

The word "researcher" looked like "researchch" was scrambled, with "er" being
replaced with "ch"; The word "important" looked like "importent", a misspelling
of the word, was scrambled. These emails may have been inspired by a letter to
New Scientist in 1999[2] from Graham Rawlinson of the University of Nottingham
in which he discusses his 1976 Ph.D. thesis[3] or perhaps by the research of
Thomas R. Jordan's group on the relative influences of the exterior and interior
letters of words.[4]
